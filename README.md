# ElvUI - Wrath of the Lich King (3.3.5a)

This is the backported version of ElvUI for World of Warcraft - Wrath of the Lich King (3.3.5a)
<br />
ElvUI is a full UI replacement.
It completely replaces the default Blizzard UI at every level with a new and better interface.
As such, you'll only ever have to update ElvUI and not worry too much about its individual components.
This UI will arrange your interface to be more flexible and practical.


## Installation:

1. Download **[Code as zip](https://github.com/aurele-l/ElvUI_Attune/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)**
2. Unpack the Zip file
3. Open the folder "ElvUI-(#.##)"
4. Copy (or drag and drop) **ElvUI** and **ElvUI_OptionsUI** into your Wow-Directory\Interface\AddOns
5. Restart WoW

## Changes vs original:

* Display attune from Synastria private server status on the items icon: green for attuned, yellow for not attuned, red for cannot be attuned items.
* Display item levels in character sheet
